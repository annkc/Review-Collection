# My Personal Project

## Project Proposal
My project will be an app that serves as a collection of reviews. It will allow one to write reviews for any media, 
from books to movies to video games, including the ability to add ratings to each review alongside a written account in 
text if one so wishes. One can create and delete as many reviews as one wishes. The reviews can be organised via folders
and alphabetical order. This app can be used by everyone and anyone who simply wishes to keep all their reviews together 
in one place and without the use of other applications. I personally very much enjoy keeping note of my thoughts after I
finish a book or an episode of a show to look back on at a later time, which is where this idea originally stemmed from.
This could possibly be useful to others, and would also be something that I would personally find to be convenient to 
have.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to *add a review to the collection an arbitrary number of times.*
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all my reviews.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a review.
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to include a rating out of 10 in each review.
